# ProjectDraft

The project currently doesn't have a title or for better wording a 'working title'.
So far this game is currently being worked on for a University project and I am trying to replicate the Source engine movement in UE4 more specifically, 
the movement for Apex Legends.

It currently has: 
- climbing 
- 8 directional movement with the animations adjusting accordingly
- sprinting
- crouching
- sliding

The next major step to working is the relative movement for the iconic Air Strafing (I know the original Quake introduced the first iteration of air strafing).

*IMPORTANT*
As this is a first draft and I am still getting comfortable with Unreal there are some inconsistencies with the organisation but I hope that can be forgiven.
